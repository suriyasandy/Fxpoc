    ### Business Interpretation

    - During the red-shaded **shock period**, volatility is artificially increased to simulate a market event.
    - Our dynamic threshold (green line) **automatically adapts** to the new reality.
    - Meanwhile, the manual threshold (red dotted line) stays flat — it doesn't respond, risking under-alerting or over-alerting.

    **Key Learning:**  
    This exercise shows how dynamic models *learn from the market* and revise alert thresholds — providing a balance of **precision and proactiveness**, which is often lacking in static thresholds.
